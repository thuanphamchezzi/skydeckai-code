# SkyDeckAI Code

An MCP server that provides a comprehensive set of tools for AI-driven development workflows. Features include file system operations, code analysis using tree-sitter for multiple programming languages, code execution, web content fetching with HTML-to-markdown conversion, multi-engine web search, code content searching, and system information retrieval. Designed to enhance AI's capability to assist in software development tasks by providing direct access to both local and remote resources.

# Formerly Known As MCP-Server-AIDD

This mcp server was formerly known as `mcp-server-aidd`. It was renamed to `skydeckai-code` to credit the team at [SkyDeck.ai](https://skydeck.ai) with creating this application along with [East Agile](https://eastagile.com). But more importantly we realized that the term AI Driven Development (AIDD) was just not catching on. People did not understand at a glance what it was about. And nor did LLMs. "Code" was far more intuitive. And linguistically intuitive is important in the world of agentic AI.

### Complex File Operations

#### edit_file

Pattern-based file editing with preview support:

```json
{
    "path": "src/main.py",
    "edits": [
        {
            "oldText": "def old_function():",
            "newText": "def new_function():"
        }
    ],
    "dryRun": false,
    "options": {
        "partialMatch": true
    }
}
```

Returns: Diff of changes or preview in dry run mode.

### Directory Operations

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| get_allowed_directory    | none                                                     | Current allowed directory path |
| update_allowed_directory | directory: string (absolute path)                        | Success confirmation           |
| list_directory           | path: string                                             | Directory contents list        |

| search_files             | pattern: string, path?: string, include_hidden?: boolean | Matching files list            |

The `search_files` tool searches for files by name pattern, while the `search_code` tool searches within file contents using regex. Use `search_files` when looking for files with specific names or extensions, and `search_code` when searching for specific text patterns inside files.

#### directory_tree

This tool uses a multi-engine approach that tries different search engines with various parsing strategies to ensure reliable results. You can specify a preferred engine, but some engines may block automated access, in which case the tool will fall back to alternative engines when "auto" is selected.

### Utility Tools

#### batch_tools

Execute multiple tool invocations in a single request with parallel execution when possible.

```json
{
    "description": "Setup new project",
    "sequential": true,
    "invocations": [
        {
            "tool": "create_directory",
            "arguments": {
                "path": "src"
            }
        },
        {
            "tool": "write_file",
            "arguments": {
                "path": "README.md",
                "content": "# New Project\n\nThis is a new project."
            }
        },
        {
            "tool": "execute_shell_script",
            "arguments": {
                "script": "git init"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| description | string | Yes | Short description of the batch operation |
| sequential | boolean | No | Whether to run tools in sequence (default: false) |
| invocations | array | Yes | List of tool invocations to execute |
| invocations[].tool | string | Yes | Name of the tool to invoke |
| invocations[].arguments | object | Yes | Arguments for the specified tool |

**Returns:**
Combined results from all tool invocations, grouped by tool with success/error status for each. Results are presented in the original invocation order with clear section headers.

This tool provides efficient execution of multiple operations in a single request. When `sequential` is false (default), tools are executed in parallel for better performance. When `sequential` is true, tools are executed in order, and if any tool fails, execution stops.

**IMPORTANT**: All tools in the batch execute in the same working directory context. If a tool creates a directory and a subsequent tool needs to work inside that directory, you must either:

1. Use paths relative to the current working directory (e.g., "project/src" rather than just "src"), or
2. Include an explicit tool invocation to change directories using `update_allowed_directory`

#### think

A tool for complex reasoning and brainstorming without making changes to the repository.

```json
{
    "thought": "Let me analyze the performance issue in the codebase:\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n1. The database query is inefficient because:\n   - It doesn't use proper indexing\n   - It fetches more columns than needed\n   - The JOIN operation is unnecessarily complex\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. **Add database indexes**:\n   - Create an index on the user_id column\n   - Create a composite index on (created_at, status)\n\n2. **Optimize the query**:\n   - Select only necessary columns\n   - Rewrite the JOIN using a subquery\n   - Add LIMIT clause for pagination\n\n3. **Add caching layer**:\n   - Cache frequent queries using Redis\n   - Implement cache invalidation strategy\n\nAfter weighing the options, solution #2 seems to be the simplest to implement with the highest impact."
}
```

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| thought | string | Yes | Your detailed thoughts, analysis or reasoning process |

**Returns:**
Your thoughts formatted as markdown, with a note indicating this was a thinking exercise.

This tool is useful for thinking through complex problems, brainstorming solutions, or laying out implementation plans without making any actual changes. It's a great way to document your reasoning process, evaluate different approaches, or plan out a multi-step strategy before taking action.

{}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "id": "abc123",
      "content": "Implement user authentication",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "metadata": {
        "custom_key": "custom_value"
      },
      "created_at": "2023-10-01T10:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-10-01T11:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1,
  "workspace": "/path/to/workspace"
}
```

#### todo_write

Replace the entire todo list for sequential execution workflow. Tasks are executed in array order, building upon previous work.

```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "id": "task1",
      "content": "Set up database schema",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "id": "task2", 
      "content": "Create API endpoints",
      "status": "pending",
      "metadata": {
        "custom_key": "custom_value"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Sequential Workflow Rules:**
- Each todo must have unique ID
- Only one task can be "in_progress" at a time (sequential execution)
- Tasks execute in array order - no priority system
- Required fields: id, content, status
- Status values: "pending", "in_progress", "completed"
- Workspace-first: Todo management is mandatory for all workspace operations

#### todo_update

Update a specific todo item by ID for sequential workflow progression.

```json
{
  "todo_id": "task1",
  "updates": {
    "status": "in_progress",
    "metadata": {
        "new_key": "new_value"
    }
  }
}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "updated_todo": {
    "id": "task1",
    "content": "Set up database schema",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "updated_at": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    "metadata": {
        "new_key": "new_value"
    }
  },
  "counts": {
    "pending": 1,
    "in_progress": 1,
    "completed": 0,
    "total": 2
  },
  "workspace": "/path/to/workspace"
}
```

The todo system maintains separate sequential task lists for each workspace, enforcing mandatory usage for all workspace operations. Tasks execute in order, building upon previous work without priority-based scheduling.

## Configuration

Configuration file: `~/.skydeckai_code/config.json`

```json
{
    "allowed_directory": "/path/to/workspace"
}
```

## Debugging

Use MCP Inspector for debugging:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector run
```

## Security

-   Operations restricted to configured allowed directory
-   Path traversal prevention
-   File permission preservation
-   Safe operation handling
